  There is even analysis suggesting that Korean Air could become a "Trump beneficiary stock." 
Lee Jae-hyuk, a researcher at LS Securities, stated, "If direct flights between the U.S. and China are restricted due to U.S.-China tensions, Korean Air could benefit from increased transit passengers," adding, 
"Even now, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines are performing well in terms of passenger traffic on U.S. routes."
