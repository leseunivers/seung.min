<h3> New update from <a href="https://www.a-propagator.com"> www.a-propagator.com </a></h3>

I just want to give my best effort to complete this web design project. Designing is something I truly enjoy, but I’ve felt no interest in my school studies. As a physics major, the longer I stay in college, the more I feel like I don’t belong here. Following the physics curriculum for a year has been incredibly challenging. It feels like my true self isn’t being recognized, and I can’t fully realize my potential. I want to find a place where I truly belong.
