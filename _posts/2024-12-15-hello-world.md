Designing is something I enjoy, but I’ve felt no interest in my school studies. As a physics major, the longer I stay in college, the more I feel like I don’t belong here. Following the physics curriculum for a year has been challenging. It feels like my true self isn’t being recognized, and I can't fully bring out the best in me. I want to find a place where I belong.
