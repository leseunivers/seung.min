<h3> How it feels after finishing final exams </h3>

I don't know what kind of value college study brings to me. When I think about it, there was a pressure from studying but it was kind of enjoyable. If I get another chance to take a test in the future, Iâ€™ll stay until the very end, thinking hard through each question. I want to put more effort. Living as a student is a part of my life and I want to do my best in every aspect. 
I feel like I haven't really focused on studying this year. Since I haven't studied hard, I feel like a part of me is rejected by myself. This feeling isn't pleasant.

However, if I hadn't done this year, I would have never known this. And to make a bit of an excuse, I really had no interest in math and science. Even if I could go back to the beginning of my first year, I don't think I would study harder. 
I feel like this experience was important for helping me to understand what I should do and who I truly am. If I get the opportunity to study in a field I enjoy, I will really put my best effort into it.
