ESMNCE is a combination of '本質' and '승민'. Focusing on core value is important. Through this, life becomes what we desire and the world is seen with joy and delight. We don’t want to live a life filled with regrets. The fact that death will come someday motivates us to do our best. Sometimes, focusing on the present brings fear of the future. Writing down intense emotions and turning them into something meaningful brings ease to the mind. I want to document the journey of my life and share it with you guys.
